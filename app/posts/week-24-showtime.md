After a few weeks of planning, this week I hosted a bumper show-the-thing session at our digital prevention services all-hands.

My aim was to try and give people a sense of how all our different services contribute to the full end-to-end journey of someone getting a vaccination.

From the public perspective this starts with a notification and invitation message in the NHS App (also sent by email and letter if needed). Then thereâ€™s the vaccination booking service. And finally seeing the vaccination record in the NHS App.

From the staff perspective there are a number of services involved, including the one Iâ€™ve been working on, Record a vaccination.

I thought the best way to bring this all together was with a bit of storytelling. And so with a few old movie style title cards, I introduced â€˜How Victoria got her vaccinationâ€™.

We had 6 live demos, from presenters across entirely different teams, with a fictional main character â€“ Victoria Vaxwell â€“ as the through-line holding the narrative together. All in 20 mins.

I had a slightly nervous moment watching the presentation in the slot before ours, which was a more formal set of slides introducing OKRs, that maybe Iâ€™d gone too far with the schtick. But I think I got away with it.

We kept to time. The rehearsal had helped, and a â€˜green roomâ€™ channel Iâ€™d created on Slack worked well for co-ordinating and thanking the presenters.

Afterwards I got lots of nice feedback from people saying they enjoyed it and found it useful. And a couple of suggestions for where the services could be more joined-up. Which is great: that was half the point.

## Change NHS

The big NHS news this week was the [launch of a national conversation to help fix the NHS](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-issues-rallying-cry-to-the-nation-to-help-fix-nhs).

The public face of this is [Change.nhs.uk](https://change.nhs.uk/en-GB/), where people are invited to contribute their experiences of the NHS and [ideas for change](https://change.nhs.uk/en-GB/projects/your-ideas-for-change).

Of course there are some â€˜comedyâ€™ ideas submitted, but the highest-rated ones seems sincere. I created an account and added my thumbs up to the ones I most agreed with.

I had some comments too about the website itself, an off-the shelf platform called [Go Vocal](https://www.govocal.com), which Iâ€™ve fed back through various channels.

The news was followed by a second announcement of [new data laws  to improve public services](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-data-laws-unveiled-to-improve-public-services-and-boost-uk-economy-by-10-billion). I canâ€™t pretend to have read the [proposed bill](https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3825) but part of it aims to make patient date more easily transferable across the NHS.

Iâ€™ve no idea how the estimated 140,000 hours of NHS staff time that itâ€™d save was calculated. But data admin definitely takes up a lot of time.

Public Digital responded with an thoughtful post on [patient records and the NHS App](https://public.digital/pd-insights/blog/2024/10/the-nhs-app-and-single-patient-records), with conclusions that are both pragmatic and radical.

Their post also notes (with a screenshot) that the way vaccination records are presented in the app is not the most user-friendly. Thankfully another team is already exploring this.

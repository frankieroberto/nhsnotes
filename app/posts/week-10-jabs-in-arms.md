Highlight of this week was definitely a day trip to Somerset to observe the service I’m working on being used at covid-19 vaccination event in Frome.

It was fantastic to be able to see the whole process, and all the different systems and people involved.

I learnt a lot, including a whole bunch of contextual things that you wouldn’t pick up on in a remote usability testing session.

As ever, there was some friction caused by digital services that don’t talk to each other. A hard one to solve but there are plans in the pipeline.

The NHS staff running the vaccination event – and a volunteer too – were real stars, and very generous with their time in answering all my questions.

## Headers

We’ve had some more good cross-NHS chats about the design of [the Header component](https://service-manual.nhs.uk/design-system/components/header) and how it could support a 'logged in' view.

It might sound trivial, but there’s some decisions to make. Should it say 'sign out' or 'log out'? Should it look like a button or a link? What about about a link to an account or profile view? Should these go top-right, or in the main navigation? Icon or no icon? And so on.

Similar discussions are being had by the [GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk) team, who did a show and tell of [their work-in-progress](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/4950) this week.

With more and more digital services becoming personalised and longer-lived than a one-off transaction, this design work is essential to improve consistency.

## Fixed deadline, variable scope

The process of cutting scope to hit a fixed deadline can be quite brutal (yet necessary), so a big shout out to product and delivery folk who’ve navigated this.

I agree with [Steve Messer](https://visitmy.website) who commented:

> Fixed time, variable scope is such a healthy habit to nurture.

But it’s still hard.

We have to keep reminding ourselves that a launch is the start not the end.

## Acronyms of the week

* [Systemized Nomenclature of Medicine - Clinical Terms](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/terminology-and-classifications/snomed-ct) (SNOMED CT) – an international list of codes for medical terms, containing everything from "lice comb" (462583007) to "heart transplant" (32413006)
* [EMIS](https://www.emishealth.com) (originally 'Egton Medical Information Systems') – this is both the name of a digital product widely used by GPs and the company who makes it
* [Role-based access control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-based_access_control) (RBAC) – this mostly seems to be an overly-complicated way of referring to permission systems

Never mind the football, I'm looking forward to the Tour de France starting this weekend!

Notes in brief from me this week:

* I enjoyed an internal talk from [James Plunkett](https://www.linkedin.com/in/james-plunkett-a1472827/) about digital-era healthcare systems. The most interest bit for me was the middle section about ‘market-shaping’, which urged the state to ‘act like a tech company’ and do things like strategic acquisition of companies and open sourcing of key products.
* [Ed](https://www.edwardhorsford.com) and I ran another session of [our training course](https://prototype-kit.service-manual.nhs.uk/training-course/) teaching people how to use the NHS Prototype kit. It was our biggest one yet, with 15 attendees (and no drop-outs!), and ran pretty smoothly. As ever, it’s very satisfying seeing people thrilled at being able to make things.
* Our monthly community of practice meeting for people in user-centred-design focused on the topic of [contributing back to the NHS digital service manual](https://service-manual.nhs.uk/community-and-contribution). This is something that’s [strongly encouraged](https://service-manual.nhs.uk/standards-and-technology/service-standard-points/13-use-and-contribute-to-open-standards-common-components-and-patterns) by the NHS service standard, but often doesn’t happen. So we ran through the different ways teams can contribute (big and small), and talked about how we can try and overcome some of the barriers to doing so.
* I’ve been continuing some design work looking at how we could enable large pharmacy chains to more easily [get reports](https://guide.ravs.england.nhs.uk/reporting/) on how many vaccinations they’ve given across all their pharmacies. Currently this is a bit of a painful one-site-at-a-time process. We’ve got an idea for a short-term improvement, but longer-term we’ll likely need to change our organisation data model.
* Some of our research has indicated that changing the order of our questions could benefit some users, for reasons we hadn’t previously anticipated. It’s not conclusive yet as the research hasn’t wrapped up, but I’ve started some early prototyping of how things could be re-jigged around.

I’m off to Paris this weekend. We’re taking the kids up the Eiffel Tower, and planning to visit some markets. Fingers crossed it doesn’t rain too much.

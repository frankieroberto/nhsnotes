Early weeknotes from me as I’m off from tomorrow on a extended weekend break.

The big NHS news this week was that [Chief Executive Amanda Pritchard is standing down](https://www.england.nhs.uk/2025/02/nhs-chief-to-stand-down-at-end-of-march/). Big thanks to her for her service - she led NHS England through the Covid pandemic which must have been enormously challenging.

Since [my post last week about OKRs](/posts/week-39-ok-arrrr/), several of you have been in touch to offer advice or guidance, thanks! I think it’s fair to say that opinion is split over whether they’re valuable or not, but I’m keeping an open mind and have started drafting mine. Maybe I’ll even share them here in a future post when they’re ready.

## Design histories

We’ve set up a new place to bring together [design histories for digital prevention services](https://design-history.prevention-services.nhs.uk).

This will hopefully be a place where our can teams can document their design decisions, why they were made, and what the trade-offs were.

In the wise words of Giles, they should [help teams remember](https://howteamsremember.com).

## Services Week

Planning is currently taking place for [Services Week 2025](https://services.blog.gov.uk/2024/12/19/services-week-is-back-for-2025/).

I’m trying hard not to volunteer to host any of the events this year, but am happy to offer support for NHS colleagues who are running some!

I’m looking forward to seeing the schedule and attending as many sessions as I can.

Off to the mountains!

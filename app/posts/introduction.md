Hello.

I’ve just started a new contract working as a designer within the Digital Prevention Services area of the NHS.

I’ve previously worked digital services for a few different central government departments, most recently at the Department for Education, but this is my first time working on NHS services.

There’s a lot to learn, but I’m excited to get started.

I’ll be using these public notes as a way of documenting the journey and sharing links to useful resources.

I’d love to connect with others working on digital services in the NHS, so if you’re up for a quick intro chat, please get in touch!

In the meantime, here’s a collection of notes from other NHS people I’ve found useful and interesting:

* [James Higgot](https://jiggott.medium.com)
* [Matt Edgar](https://blog.mattedgar.com)
* [Trilly Chatterjee](https://medium.com/@trillyc)

(Let me know any I’m missing!)
